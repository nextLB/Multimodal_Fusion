识别文本: my fellow Americans. And the people who brought me the dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpenter down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sisters and my sisters and my sisters, Valerie. Anyway. Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who doesn't see red states and blue states only sees the United States. And work for all my heart with the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, it's here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I would not be here without her love and tireless support of Jill and my son, Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren. And their spouses and all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. And she is dedicated to her life to education. But she teaches it just what she does, it's who she is. For American educators, this is a great day for you all. You're going to have one of your own in the White House. And Jill's going to make a great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I have the honor of serving with a fantastic Vice President. He just served from Kamala Harris. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set. The first daughter of an immigrant. Ever elected in this country. Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States. It's long overdue. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, your family. You're becoming honorary Biden. There's no way out. All those of you volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team and all the volunteers. And all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you. I owe you everything. And all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built and ran. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Modders, Conservatives. Young old, Urban, Suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I'm meeting, especially those moments. And especially those moments with this campaign was that as low as they ever. The African-American community stood up again for a minute. He's my banner. And I'll have yours. I said at the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what I think the administration will look like and act like. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. Americans have called upon us to march on the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to march on the forces of science, and the forces of fairness. The forces of hope in the great battles of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the built prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint. That will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim air of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress, Democrats.

识别文本: Oh, okay. Brad couldn't be here tonight due to family obligations, so he asked me to read his response for him. Okay, he starts by saying, hey, Britain, heard you just became single, welcome to the club. Oh, oh, wishing you the best with the divorce settlement, blah, blah, blah. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Ariane Phillips for his also tight jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. Here's Old Mate Simon Jones and the one and only Quentin Tarantino. Applause. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's a bit much really, oh, and he says that he is gonna name this Harry because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.

识别文本: This isn't the first time I've been mistaken for Ryan Reynolds, but it's getting out of hand. Ryan obviously has been some kind of mistake, but I'm up here, so if you don't mind. OK. Damian and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want. I don't really want to do that because who would get what piece and no one wants the bottom and we fight over the top? It could tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. It's ours. Thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people, and there's just no time to think everyone. I just would like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film. My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So, sweetheart, thank you. To my daughters, Amada and Esmeralda, I love you. And if I may, I'd like to dedicate this to the memory of her brother, Juan Carlos Mendez. Thank you very much to the HFPA. Good night.

识别文本: Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time, by the way, we have to fix that. Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone, whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply, and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service, and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America's Happy Warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too, as our nation's first lady. Sasha Malia, before our very eyes, you're growing up to become too strong, smart, beautiful young women. I'm just like your mom, and I'm so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will have the lifelong appreciation of the grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of eagles or the domain of special interests. And if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out our rallies crowded along the rope line in the high school gym or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism and the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. The democracy and the nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. It won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter. And we can't just chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. A country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.

识别文本: Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Floatplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. Like, really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I have some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be Chief Vision Officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about Creative Officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. And I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't... I'm not really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate bio that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash. 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives. For our kids to do that. And for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it. And there were a few reasons for that. First is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do? Buy an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this. But you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivon and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first. We want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then. Who the hell is this guy, right? The key knight among you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position. Because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled of administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, if I'm being honest, really. One of our other colleagues, be grudging shout out to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shout out Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go. Damn, I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Yvonne, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now, I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail. And not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formerly wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up. And sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Microcenter. This summer marks the opening of their first store in eight years in Indianapolis with two more stores set to open by 2025.

If you guys want some more context for this big change, I would suggest checking out the I'm thinking of retiring stream. I still can't watch it just to find the timestamps for what I'd put in the video earlier. I had to just download a transcript and it's just rough. But it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bringing you guys the best content that I can.

识别文本: Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a, it's not a short speech, so just I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began I was 20 years old and I had put out my self titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Oh, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off and Blank Space. Basically if people had something to say about me I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Elm of the Year at the Grammys and I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever. You gotta give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of push back but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating over correcting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. Alright. Okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Sick. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No. That criticism is reserved for us. But you know I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alba the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo. Rosalia. Taylor Parks. Julie Kiyoko. King Princess. Camila Cabello. Halsey. Megan Vistallian. Princess Nokia. Nina Nezbit. Sigrid. Normani. Her. Maggie Rogers. Becky G. Do Alipa. Ella May. Philly Eilish. And so many other amazing women who are making music right now. No artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.

识别文本: description. So I thought, I try to think, what is the most useful thing that I could, what could I say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future? And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen? And maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me. But then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Autocie Clock, which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back, say, 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stake for, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, and that's like magic, and I would be really cool. And I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works, and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 1995. That's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. And obviously, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so did some internet stuff. You know, did a few things here and there. One of which was PayPal. And maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started, because initially, the initial thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and works smoothly. And then we had a little feature, which was to do email payments. And whenever we'd show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the agglomeration of financial services, which was quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we'd show people email payments, which was actually quite easy, and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You know, you want to be as close loop as possible. And so we focused on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on them when you see them. And you're correct your prior assumptions. And then, let me ask you a question. Going from PayPal, I thought of what are some of the other problems. That are likely to most affect the future of humanity. It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to make money. Which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't solve that, the century, the century, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multiplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then, I thought, well, what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought, well, if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with the dehydrated, which was seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel, and you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore, increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in late 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. They thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. And after making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong. Because my initial thought was that there was not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I came to the conclusion that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. The people who came here from other parts of the world. I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then, or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve. To solve the space transport problem and started SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. My one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical. So I'd figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.

识别文本: I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard fort campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, hours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They are great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. The Melania and Don. And Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. They kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you. It's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani, Chris. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. Hey, that Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Very strong. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the Chatta? Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?
